# python_input_function

## Task 1
Write a Python program that asks the user to add a number and checks if the number is positive, negative, or zero. The program should print an appropriate message.
Example:
If the input is 5, the program should print: "The number is positive."
If the input is -3, the program should print: "The number is negative."
If the input is 0, the program should print: "The number is zero."

## Task 2
Use a foor-loop and create a python programm to print numbers from 1 to 10.

## Task 3
Create a python programm that asks the user to enter a number. Keep asking with a while-loop for a new number until the user enters an even number. Once an even number is provided, print it and end the programm (break the loop).

## Task 4
Create a function named sum_of_squares that calculates and retunrs the sum of squares of two given numbers.

## Task 5
Create a python programm that counts from 1 to 100. 
- For numbers divisible by 3 and 5 print "FizzBuzz". 
- For numbers divisible by 3 print "Fizz". 
- For numbers divisble by 5 print "Buzz". 
- For all other numbers, simply print the number itself.
